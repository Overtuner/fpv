# Custom FPV Transmitter for ZMR250

I had a number of annoyances related to the BOSCAM FPV transmitter I initially purchased for my ZRM250 quadcopter. I also stumbled across a German RC forum post where an individual had developed their own transmitter based around the TX5823 200mW 5.8GHz transmitter found in many pre-packaged FPV transmitters. While not perfect, it was a great starting point and served as the inspiration for this project. (TODO: link)

This project seeks to produce a 200mW FPV transmitter with the following specifications:

  - Easily mounted securely on the ZMR250 frame.

  - Simple to change channels (no buried DIP switches!!)

  - Has frequency agility supporting all current receiver channels
